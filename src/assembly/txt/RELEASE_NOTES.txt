New features
------------
- 0000056: [Feature request] Comment per timesheet entry
A new feature was added allowing a person to write a small comment for
each entry in the timesheet describing for example what (s)he did in that period.
Comments can be added by clicking on the pencil icon next to the input box for hours.
When the icon is grey no comment was filled out and when the icon is yellow a comment
already exists.

- 0000075: [Feature request] Only aggregated reports available, add per-day reporting
Day-to-day reporting 

A new type of report was added which displays all day-to-day data.
Also the layout of the report screen has been changed giving the actual reports more screen size.
To access the new report log in as a user with the reporting role. In the screen where
you normally would select the report criteria a new dropdown has been added on the right where
you can select the type of report you want to create. All existing filtering criteria can be applied
to the detailed report.
