New features
------------

- 0000056: [Feature request] Comment per timesheet entry
A new feature was added allowing a person to write a small comment for
each entry in the timesheet. In previous releases only a comment per week
could be added and these comments didn't appear on any report. In this
release per project, per day a unique comment can be written where a person
could explain what (s)he did in those hours.
Comments can be added by clicking on the pencil icon next to the input box for hours.
When the icon is grey no comment was filled out, when the icon is yellow a comment
already exists.

- 0000075: [Feature request] Only aggregated reports available, add per-day reporting
A new type of report was added which displays all day-to-day data.
Also the layout of the report screen has been changed giving the actual reports more screen size.
To access the new report log in as a user with the reporting role. In the screen where
you normally would select the report criteria a new dropdown has been added on the right where
you can select the type of report you want to create. All existing filtering criteria can be applied
to the detailed report.

- 0000074: [Bug / defect] Logging can't be configured


- 0000070: [Bug / defect] Can't reset report criteria
The report filtering criteria screen can't be resetted. A "clear criteria" button is added so
you can reset the criteria to their initial state.

- 0000067: [Bug / defect] Print timesheet icon ends up in next month
Clicking the print timesheet icon on the overview page of users didn't end up in the selected
month but in the next month. Fixed.

- 0000026: [Bug / defect] Cannot show dates as mm/dd/yyyy
The date locale wasn't respected when inputting dates in the admin section and defaulted to
European style. Fixed.

- 0000062: [Bug / defect] First name of user is required although it shouldn't
