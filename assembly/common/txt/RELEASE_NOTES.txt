eHour 1.2.1 release notes (2 June 2013)
------------------------------------------
And eHour reaches version 1.2.1 - a bug-fix release fixing the following issues:

[EHO-306] Internet Explorer 8's compatibility mode was not properly overriden. In other words,
          eHour now properly works with IE8 even when IE8 is set to be in IE7 compatible mode.
[EHO-322] The full name of a user (first and last name) is shown in the detailed report
[EHO-323] In eHour 1.2 changes were made to how the configured currency to use is stored in the database. 
	 	  However the default value, when you install eHour for the first time, was not set properly and eHour
	 	  didn't handle this correctly. The default currency is now set to a correct value.
[EHO-327] The excel export of the detailed report crashed when trying to export a larger data set (more than 200 users).
[EHO-328] All the excel exports in the global reporting section returned the "project export" excel.



eHour 1.2 release notes (15 May 2013)
------------------------------------------
TE-CON is proud to present eHour 1.2.

In version 1.2 the underlying web framework (Wicket) has been upgraded from version 1.4.20 to 6.7. This fixes
deployment issues on the latest Tomcat versions and increases browser compatibility.
The export month feature was a bit enhanced, rather than just exporting a month you can now export any date range;
be it a week or multiple months.
The calendar/datepicker now uses the proper date format and a Finnish translation is added, thanks to Janne Viljanen.

***
 Due to a change in how the configured locale and currency is stored, you may need to reset the localization, the
 language and the currency in System -> Configure eHour -> Localization tab

eHour 1.0 release notes (15 June 2012)
--------------------------------------
TE-CON is proud to present a new release of eHour, version 1.0 ! This new version has:

An improved standalone version
install4j kindly donated a license for their installer allowing eHour to use a "next-next-next" installer. On Windows, eHour is now automatically installed as a service and oh, there's 64-bit support as well.

An improved user interface
Previous versions of eHour used a fixed width of your browser, regardless of how much screen estate your browser owned. eHour 1.0 uses the full available width of your browser, replacing customer/project codes with their full names when space allows. Columns are re-sized to use the full width which gives a more clear and usable view, especially in the reports.

Internet Explorer support is improved, some glitches and layout issues with Internet Explorer 8 are fixed.

Many bug fixes and (minor) improvements
There are a lot of bugs squashed like users with the PM role who couldn't be edited, incorrect week number calculation, etc. The Italian translation has been revised.

All bugs that are resolved:

[EHO-10] - Print and excel icons are now properly positioned
[EHO-95] - When entering an invalid date into the calendar, the calendar didn't work anymore - even with valid input. Fixed

[EHO-223] - The "reset" button in the report now resets all criteria, including "only billable"

eHour 0.9.1 release notes (23 April 2011)
-----------------------------------------
eHour 0.9.1 adds MySQL and PostgreSQL support to the standalone version, enabling the standalone version to run in a production environment.

The concept of the eHour home directory is introduced. The home directory holds the log files and translations files are loaded from there. This allows you to improve or add translations in an easy fashion.

From the web UI, eHour's database can now be imported/exported from/to an external file. This export can be used as a backup file or to migrate between servers. The export file is database independent so an export from the 0.8.4 standalone database can be imported in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database. The export requires at least Java 1.6.0_19.

A number of improvements were done on the UI. When there are unsaved hours in a timesheet and the user navigates away, a warning message will be shown. The main navigation is also improved.

The full list of JIRA issues (http://dev.ehour.nl/jira/) that are resolved:

New Feature
[EHO-159] - Load translations from external files
[EHO-157] - Update help texts in app and provide link backs to Wiki
[EHO-150] - Add MySQL/PostgreSQL support to the standalone version
[EHO-200] - Warning when navigating away from an unsaved timesheet
[EHO-204] - Allow backup, restore and port with external file

Bug
[EHO-3] - ehcache cache timeout too small
[EHO-67] - Not compatible with MySQL 5.1 connector
[EHO-155] - Excel export of current month doesn't fit on A4
[EHO-170] - Locale.setDefault shouldn't be changed in EhourWebSession
[EHO-189] - Remove references to swfobject.js
